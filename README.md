# Ray

Simple and embeddable language written in Zig.

![Pipeline Tests](https://github.com/martinrov/ray/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## Why Ray

Ray is designed to sum up all the different features I found interesting from the languages I know.
It's heavily inspirated from *Rust* and *Zig* but is still an interpreted language meant to be easy to use and learn.

Its primary use case to be embedded in other applications as a scripting language but anything can be done in *Ray*,
especially thanks to the native *C* interop.

## Documentation

A kind-of-up-to-date specification of the language shows the targetted features and syntax.
